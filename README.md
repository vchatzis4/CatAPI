# CatAPI Project
A .NET Core Web API that fetches images and metadata of cats from the CatAPI, stores them in a SQL Server database, and ensures there are no duplicate records. This project showcases integration with external APIs, data persistence, and entity relationships in a SQL database using Entity Framework Core.
